            <p>1st Patrol</p>
            <span>U-96 departed Kiel on 4 December 1940 on her first patrol. Her route took her across the North Sea, through the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands and into the Atlantic Ocean.She was soon in the thick of the action; sinking Rotorua and Towra on the 11th and Macedonier on the 12th. She then damaged Empire Razorbill with six rounds from her deck gun on the 14th and sank Western Prince, also on the 14th.</span>

            <span>For her second foray, U-96 departed Lorient on 9 January 1941 and returned to the waters west of Scotland, sinking the Oropesa on 16 January and the Almeda Star a day later. The Almeda Star was lost with all hands and passengers, a total of 360 people. U-96 docked once more in Lorient on the 22nd.</span>

            <span>U-96 sortied from Lorient on 30 January 1941, sinking Clea and Arthur F. Corwin near Iceland on 13 February. Five more ships went to the bottom on this patrol: the Black Osprey on 18 February, Scottish Standard on the 22nd, (which had already been bombed by a Focke Wulf 'Condor' and abandoned by her crew), Anglo-Peruvian on the 23rd, Linaria and Sirishna a day later.
The boat returned to St. Nazaire in France on 28 February.</span>

            <p>4th Patrol</p>
            <span>The carnage continued; in one attack the boat sank Oilfield, Port Hardy and Caledonia south of Iceland on 28 April 1941 and in turn was depth charged by the Flower class corvette HMS Gladiolus. It was originally thought that the British ship had sunk U-65, but U-96 escaped unscathed. She went on to sink Empire Ridge 90 nautical miles (170 km; 100 mi) west of Bloody Foreland (Ireland), before returning to St. Nazaire on 22 May.</span>
